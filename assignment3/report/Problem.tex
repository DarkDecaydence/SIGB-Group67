\section{Problem Statement}
The assignment is split into six parts, the first two being the introduction and this problem statement. The remaining four parts describe our assignment.\newline

With this assignment, as with the last, we have been supplied \emph{SIGB-Tools.py}, containing useful tools to help us along the way.\newline

In the third part of the assignment, we will explain how we achieved projection of the cube onto a checkboard using textures and how we prepared it for illumination.\newline

We will follow up by explaining the shading in section four of this assignment, achieved with Phong illumination in its three parts; ambient, diffuse, and specular.\newline

In sections five and six, we will discuss challenges and problems we faced with the assignment before we conclude our report.
