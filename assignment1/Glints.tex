\subsection{Finding the glints with Thresholds}
To find the glints, we have applied the same techniques as used to find the pupil.\newline

The main difference is that we have not used morphology when finding the glints, due to the use of an open/close operation when finding the pupil. Using another open/close operation to isolate the glints would be completely redundant.\newline

In addition, we use only one filter when finding the glints; an area filter. Since our pupil tracking morphology has already removed many potential candidates by removing most minor contours, we have a small maxSize to search for, trying to find the glints.
