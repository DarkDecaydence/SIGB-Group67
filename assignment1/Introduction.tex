Introduction

This report is for the first assignment of Introduction to Graphics and Image Analysis 

In this assignment we are given the task to detect various features of the eyes like pupil, glints and iris. For this detection we will use several techniques, algorithms, and concepts we have learned in the course like thresholding, segmenting, and morphology. The assignment in divided into two parts. The outcome for the first part is to detect the center of the pupil and the glints on an video or image sequences and the outcome of the second part is to extend the previous implementation to detect the iris region and remove glints outside this region.
