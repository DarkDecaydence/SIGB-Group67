\section{Conclusion}
This two part assignment helped us to implement the knowledge acquired through the course to find important features of the eyes like the pupil, glints and iris. For the first part of the assignment, through morphology and physical characteristics of the pupil like area and extension ratio, we were able to find and track the pupil in most of the cases but our method still has some imperfections. For the second part of the assignment the implementation was extended for detection of the iris using the gradients in the image, although this was less than successful.\\
