\section{Introduction}
Our purpose in this assignment is to explore the uses of homographies, and apply our newfound knowledge to accomplish different goals.\newline

The assignment is split in two major parts (part one and part two), each separated into smaller assignments. Throughout the report, we have made an effort to address all of these assignments.\newline

To help us along the way, we have been given the \textsl{SIGB-Tools.py} library, containing useful functions to help us.\newline

In part one, the first major assignment is to track a person who is moving around in the atrium of the IT-university. To solve this assignment, we have been given the datafile \textsl{trackingdata.dat}, containing the data relevant to the person walking in atrium.\newline

The second major assignment of part one, is to insert a texture onto the picture using \textbf{texture mapping}.\newline

In the second part of the assignment, we are tasked to explore \textbf{camera calibration} and \textbf{augmentation}. Here, we will make use of a webcam, calibrate it and project a nonexistent cube onto a surface defined by a chessboard.
