	\subsection{Floor tracking}
	We observe that the path located on the floor roughly corresponds to the position of the person in the video at all times. We observe a small jitter in the path, which can be explained by a similar effect in the data set.\\
	As it is assumed that the person is walking on the plane of the floor at all times, we expected a noticeable distortion when the person walks onto the stairs, and thus is raised above the floor. This effect is expected to take place, but is too small to observe.
